# Weather-ToDo
<<<<<<< HEAD

Simple responsive TODO list app using HTML5/CSS3/Javascript ES6 to implement the solution. For user experience I added Bootstrap library. The app allows user to add/edit/remove/filter tasks. Tasks are available for the user even when he returns to the app after the browser was closed. Also I added a simple widget presenting weather in Warsaw based on https://www.metaweather.com/api/
