# Weather-ToDo

Simple responsive TODO list app using HTML5/CSS3/Javascript ES6 to implement the solution. For user experience I added Bootstrap library. The app allows user to add/edit/remove/filter tasks. Tasks are available for the user even when he returns to the app after the browser was closed. Also I added a simple widget presenting weather in Warsaw based on https://www.metaweather.com/api/

# How to run / build / test your creation.

I used simply HTML, CSS and Javascript, so I wasn't obligatory to build any API. But for heroku needed I made .php for deploying site to web. If you want to run my site on localhost simply pull or download repository and open .html file.

# Your thought process when creating the solution.

Firstly I made some template for making an To-Do list site. Then I implement Javascript file name: todo.js for saving all informations in localstorage. You can menage your tasks by simply navigate buttons. Secondly, I made Javascript file name: weatherTemp.js for AJAX requesting some information from https://www.metaweather.com/api/. Then I wrote template for my weather informations. At the end I tried to put all together and change some User Experience looking.

# Anything you might implement with more time (features, fixes, technical debt corrections etc).

At first User Experience, escpecially on the responsive side. Also, I would make features in to-do list. For weather visualization I could use some frameworks to make some splash arts or better looking containers.
